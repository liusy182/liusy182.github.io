# Ideas

`Startup === Growth`

Not just trying to poke holes, see how could he possibly win

Start up is a hypothesis, before start building anything, it should have:
- Problem, 
- Solution 
- Insight

#### Problem

- Popular
- Growing
- Urgent
- Expensive
- Mandatory
- Frequent (super important)

The startup idea must have a few of them, and at least one of them

An ideal problem:
- 1M users
- market growth 20% / year, 
- Billion dollar market, 
- Urgent problem, 
- Law changed, 
- People needs multiple times a day

DO NOT "Solution in search of a problem": know a technology, and look back at: ok what problem can i solve with that? - This is bad

Insight on the problem is your unfair advantage. Startup need one.

Founders: 1 in 10 of all the people in the world who can solve this problem  

Market: 20% growth a year

Product: 10x better than competition

Acquisition: $0. How to grow without having to pay for it

Monopoly: as your growth, how are you stronger to defeat competition

#### How good investor evaluate an idea
- Do i understand it?
- Am i excited by the idea?
- Do i like the team?

Make things EASY to understand - legible, simple, obvious

# MVP

- should have very limited functionality
- should appeal to a small set of users

You will need a heavy MVP when
- Significant regulation

# Co-founder

having a co-founder is really good, but a bad cofounder is worse than no co founder

select for determination, shared history

values first, aptitude second, specific skills third

# Product market fit

Only one way to grow when you are small:  "Doing things that dont scale" - http://paulgraham.com/ds.html

talk to users to understand the problem and challenges users facing - airbnb

Product Market fit - retention is the best way to determine that
use data to see if you have made something people want: 
- identify metric
- measure REPEAT USAGE of the metrics

These are not good metrics for product market fit:
- registered users
- visitors
- conversion rate
- non-paying customer

2 ways to grow at scale:
- product growth / conversion rate optimization
- (new) growth channels

conversion rate optimization areas
- internationalization
- onboarding
- authentication
- purchase conversion

# Pivot
What is pivot?
- Change idea when the product is truly live

Why pivot?
- opportunity cost: working on something that is not working v.s. changing to something with bigger potential

Shareware - 0.5%
Casual download games - 2%
Fremium Saas - 1.5% to 5%
