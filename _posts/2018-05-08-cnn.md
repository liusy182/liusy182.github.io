Notes from course [Convolutional Neural Networks].

# Summary of convolutions

given

- `n x n` image

- padding `p`

- `f x f` filter

- stride `s`

we will end up getting a convoluted image with dimension

```
floor(1 + (n + 2p - f) / s)

            X

floor(1 + (n + 2p - f) / s)
```

One **advantage** of CNN is that although a given image can be very big, the
number of parameters are fixed for a CNN network. For example, if we have 10
filters that are 3 x 3 x 3 in one layer. We only have a total of
[3 * 3 * 3 + 1 (bias)] * 10 = 280 parameters.

# Summary of pooling

hyperparameters:

- f: filter size

- s: stride size

- pooling method: max pooling, average pooling

There is NO parameter to be learnt.

# Why convolution?

- parameter sharing

  a feature detector (such as vertical edge detector) that is useful in one part
  of the image is probably useful in another part of the image

- sparsity of connections

  in each layer, each output value depends only on a small number of inputs
