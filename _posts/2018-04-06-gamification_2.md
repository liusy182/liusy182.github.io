Gamification is about psychology, about **motivational design**.

2 major areas in psychology:

**behaviorism**: what people do. how people behavior.

It treats people's mind as a black box. It conducts tests based on people's bahavior to come out with hypothesis.

Stimulus -> behaviors -> consequences

Press a button -> food come out -> reward

Press another button -> electrified -> punishment

Both results to learning.

**cognitivism**: what people think. what is their mental state.


### Behavior Economics

- Loss aversion: people are more sensitive to loss than gainss

- Power of defaults: if by default is opt-in, post people would opt in.

- Confirmation bias: if you are looking for certain result, you tend to get it.


### Lessons learnt from Behaviorism

- Watch people do. People don't always behave in the way you might think.

- Importance of feedback.

- Conditioning through consequences. Show different conditions based on different
consequences. (Connection with feedback loop)

- Reinforcement through rewards.


### Reward structures

- Tangible / Intangible

  e.g. Money, Credits v.s. Badge, "good job"

- Expected / Unexpected

- Contingency

  - Task non-contingency: you get reward no matter what (not very common)

  - Engagement-contingency: reward paid upon starting a task

  - Completion-contingency: reward paid upon completing a task

  - Performance-contingency: reward paid based on performance

**Uncertainty makes reward more interesting to people.**

### Limits of behaviorism

- it only monitors what people do, but not what people think

- potential for abuse / manipulation. E.g. slot machine, addictive

- hedonic treadmill. Once start giving people reward, better keep doing it.

- overemphasis on Status

### Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation

- Intrinsic: do it because you want to

- extrinsic: money, fame, fortune

Rewards based on extrinsic motivation may crowd out intrinsic motivation that
is already there. As a result, it can be de-motivating. The rewards substitutes
for the intrinsic motivation.

E.g. late-charge for parents who come late to pick up kids. The idea was to
punish (reverse of reward) late parents. But parents may take it as an economic
exchange and come in even later.
