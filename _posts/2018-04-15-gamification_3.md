### Design thinking

- Purposive

- Human centered

- Balance of analytical & creative

- Iterative

### D6 for designing gamified system

- Define Business Objectives

  E.g. business goals of "four square":

  - social sharing, getting people into the habit of checking in

  - influencer marketing. Mayor of a location can get coupons. If you become a
  mayor, can do marketing using your status.

- Delineate target behaviors

  - Specific:

    Define what you want user to do. E.g. i want to find the best people to be
    hired for this job by distinguishing people's skills.

  - Success matrix. Define win state

  - Analytics. What are the ways to measure success matrix.

    e.g. DAU/MAU, The higher the ratio, the more engaging customers are

    Virality - the ratio of people refer other people to the site. The more
    people refers, the more viral the system is.

    Volume of activity - track the activity so that to understand more about
    user behavior.


- Describe your players

  4 broader types of players (Bartle BBOG player types):

  e.g. players who wants to interact with the world are explorers

  ```
                        acting
                           |
               [killers]   |  [achievers]
  players ---------------------------------- world
             [socializers] |  [explorers]
                           |
                      interacting
  ````

- Devise activity loops

  engagement loop :

  ```
  motivation -> action -> feedback ---
      |                               |
      |--------------------------------
  ```

- Don't forget the fun

- Deploy the appropriate tools
