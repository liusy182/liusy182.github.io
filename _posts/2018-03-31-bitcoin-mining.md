Continuing on [Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Technologies], this week's material talked
about bitcoin mining.

6 steps of mining:

1. join a network, listen to transactions

2. list for new blocks, maintain blockchain

3. assemble a new valid block

4. find a nonce that makes your block valid

5. hope everybody accepts your block

6. take profit

mining difficult is set every 2 weeks:

```
next difficulty = previous difficulty * (2 weeks) / (time to min last 2016 blocks)


2016 = 10mins * 6 * 24 (hr) * 14 (days)
```

Mining hardware evolution: CPU - GPU - FPGA - bitcoin ASICS


Source of energy consumption

1. Chip manufacturing

2. Electricity for mining

3. Cooling facility

About energy consumption: I always felt bitcoin mining wastes too much energy.
This lecture gives an interesting point that traditional currency needs energy
to maintain as well (ATMs, vehicles to transfer currency around, etc). The heat
generated by bitcoin mining can be converted to other uses such as heater. I look
forward to see innovations emerge in that area.

**Mining pools**: Individual miners participate in a mining pool to lower down
variance and share profit.

How does mining pool manager knows how much individual miners perform? Individual
miners submit almost-valid blocks to miner manager (e.g. instead od 64 leading
zeros, miner manager may look for 40 leading zeros from participants as a
proof of work).

One way to distribute profit in proportion to the number of almost-valid blocks.
