I started taking a course on [gamification] this week. Here are some notes I
jotted down for the first 2 weeks' material.

## Elements of gamification

Products and business with gamification share some common elements.

- Progression: Players able to progress in the gameplay.

- Levels: e.g. difficulty level, player skill level.

- Quests: Players search for a goal in the gameplay.

- Social Graph: Elements of social interactions.

- Rewards

- Avatars: plays' profile in the virtual world

## Goals of a game designer

1. How to get your players playing. How to attract people play.

2. How to keep them playing. How to engage them for a sustained period of time.

## Basic game design rules

1. The player journey

    - Onboarding - how to make them get started ASAP

    - Scaffolding - training, overcome complexity, make game easier

    - Pathways to mastery - enable player to conquer and achieve something.

2. Balance

    Not too easy, not too difficult. Not too simple, not too complex.

    Keep the numbers in balance so that people at all skill levels feel fun to play.

3. Create a Experience


## Some interesting quotes about game:

"Game is a closed, formal system that engages players in a structured conflict,  and revolves in an unequal outcome." - Tracy Fullerton, Chris Swan, Steven Hoffman

"A game is a series of meaningful choices" - Sid Meier
