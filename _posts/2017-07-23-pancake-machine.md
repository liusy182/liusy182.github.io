Thanks to my brilliant teammates, I was able to attend this year's [maker faire] with a lovely
pancake machine. It is quite an amazing experience seeing a simple machine attracting so much
attention during the exhibition. Many kids were drawn by the idea of drawing and printing their
self-designed pancakes. People from F&B industry provided candid feedback and 
even hinted possible collaboration in the future. Anyway, it is still a prototype :)

It is hard to believe that we made it fully functional only 2 days before exhibition. A lot of hard 
work went in over the past week: hardware experts doing last-minute circuit board debugging; 
software guys doing final calibration; and 3D-printing enthusiasts printing out final components to 
be assembled. 

As a guy who mainly contributed to the software part of the system, I 
have to say a big thank you to the open source community. There were so 
many open source references out there. My job was to find them, understand them, integrate
them and make them work together. Building a complete solution of supporting free hand drawing of
pancakes, exporting drawing to file, p2p transferring of file and finally converting the file to 
motor instructions was not possible within such a short time frame without the help of open source.

Hardwares have also advanced over the years. I remember the days when I was still a Electrical
Engineering student, I spent huge amount of time to figure out circuit malfunction which eventually
turned out to be either a missing capacitor or dropped voltage somewhere. Today, hardwares are so 
readily available with ICs replacing most part of self-designed PCBs, and raspberry-pi replacing 
easily-burnt PICs. Making things become a lot more hassle-free and interesting than 
before.
